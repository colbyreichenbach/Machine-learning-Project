# MLB Injury Prediction Analysis
This repository contains the project analysis of the paper "Machine Learning Outperforms Regression Analysis to Predict Next-Season Major League Baseball Player Injuries" by Karnuta et al. (2020). The project aims to critique and extend the work found in the paper by examining both the statistical methodologies used and the ethical considerations of applying machine learning (ML) models for injury prediction in professional athletes, specifically within Major League Baseball (MLB).

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore the merits and potential limitations of using ML to predict MLB player injuries, as proposed by Karnuta et al. (2020). This investigation includes a detailed critique of the statistical methods employed in the paper, a discussion on the ethical implications of predictive modeling in sports, and an additional analysis conducted to verify or extend the paper's findings.

# Objectives
Critique of Statistical Methodology: Provide a comprehensive analysis of the statistical methods used in the original study, including the data collection process, ML algorithms, and validation techniques. 

Replication of Statiscical Methodology: Provide an attempt to replicate results concluded from the original study.

Ethical Consideration Analysis: Delve into the ethical implications of using ML for injury prediction, focusing on privacy, bias, fairness, impact on players' careers, and the balance between technological advancement and moral responsibility.
