# MLB Injury Prediction Analysis
This repository contains the project analysis of the paper "Machine Learning Outperforms Regression Analysis to Predict Next-Season Major League Baseball Player Injuries" by Karnuta et al. (2020). The project aims to critique and extend the work found in the paper by examining both the statistical methodologies used and the ethical considerations of applying machine learning (ML) models for injury prediction in professional athletes, specifically within Major League Baseball (MLB).

# Objectives
Critique of Statistical Methodology: Provide a comprehensive analysis of the statistical methods used in the original study, including the data collection process, ML algorithms, and validation techniques. 

Replication of Statiscical Methodology: Provide an attempt to replicate results concluded from the original study.

Ethical Consideration Analysis: Delve into the ethical implications of using ML for injury prediction, focusing on privacy, bias, fairness, impact on players' careers, and the balance between technological advancement and moral responsibility.
